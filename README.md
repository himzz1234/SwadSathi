# SwadSathi
Swadsathi is a React Native mobile application built with Expo. It aims to digitalize the food ordering process in school and college canteens to reduce overcrowding and delays.

## Problem Statement
Overcrowding and delays in school and college canteens cause significant inconvenience to students. Long queues during lunch breaks lead to extended waiting times and frustration. Additionally, the lack of real-time stock updates results in students wasting time only to find their preferred items unavailable.

## Features
- Canteens can generate their own QR codes, allowing students to scan and access canteen details, menus, and addresses. Once scanned, the canteen remains on the studentâ€™s app homepage for easy access.
- Students receive real-time updates on food availability, preventing unnecessary queueing for unavailable items.
- Students can place orders directly through the app and receive a unique token number for order pickup, reducing wait times and streamlining the pick-up process.
- Students get timely updates on scanned canteens and their menus, keeping them informed about new offerings or changes.
