# SwadSathi
Swadsathi is a React Native mobile application built with Expo. It aims to digitalize the food ordering process in school and college canteens to reduce overcrowding and delays.

## Problem Statement
Overcrowding and delays in school and college canteens cause significant inconvenience to students. Long queues during lunch breaks lead to extended waiting times and frustration. Additionally, the lack of real-time stock updates results in students wasting time only to find their preferred items unavailable.
